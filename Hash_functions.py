def createNumber_permutation(listASCII):
    '''
    Convert the list of ASCII to a number. The goal is to have the same number no matter the permutations. 
    So if we have 2 password "ABC" and "ACB", the function generate the same number. So for that we are using

    We choose 99 because it's not too big soo the number is not too large and it's not too small to avoid colision.
    We remove 32 to our ASCII because the numbers from 0 to 32 of the ASCII table are not characters.
